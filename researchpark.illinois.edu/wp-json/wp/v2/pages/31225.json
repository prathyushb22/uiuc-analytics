it has sprouted a vibrant, multidisciplinary community producing highly influential technological advances \u2013 a reflection of the modernization of its land-grant roots in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aces.illinois.edu\/\">agriculture\u00a0<\/a>and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/grainger.illinois.edu\/\">engineering\u00a0<\/a>.<\/p><p>\u201cThe mission of the Research Park is much in collaboration with the mission of the University of Illinois,\u201d said Ed McMillan, past chairman of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/researchpark.illinois.edu\/about\/board-of-managers\/\">Board of Managers for the Research Park\u00a0<\/a>and University of Illinois trustee. \u201cIn addition to teaching \u2013 in addition to research and outreach \u2013 it\u2019s also commercialization of technology.\u201d<\/p><p>The Research Park was approved by the Board of Trustees in November 1999. The University established a separate University of Illinois Research Park Limited Liability Company in March 2000 for governance of the Research Park. Since the first building opened its doors in January 2001, Research Park\u2019s growth and development have been a boon in multiple ways for the University.<\/p><p>Three of its most significant value propositions have been the opportunities afforded for faculty to develop and commercialize new technology in conjunction with their academic work; for established companies to collaborate with University of Illinois faculty and researchers; and for students to experience highly regarded internship opportunities.<\/p><p>The Research Park\u2019s thriving innovative community is the result of an intentional transformation in the University of Illinois\u2019 approach to entrepreneurial activity, one that encompasses the entire campus.<\/p><p>\u201cIt means many resources are there to support (entrepreneurs), through mentoring and financing and building, as well as promoting that this is a good activity to do,\u201d said\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/researchpark.illinois.edu\/staff\/laura-frerichs\/\">Laura Appenzeller<\/a>, Research Park Director. \u201cWe support and encourage entrepreneurship and taking what is being done in a research lab and translating that into a commercializable product.\u201d<\/p><p>The State of Illinois provided funding to build\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/researchpark.illinois.edu\/locate-here\/enterpriseworks-incubator\/\">EnterpriseWorks<\/a>, the early-stage tech firm business incubator, in 2003, and the first tenants moved in in early 2004. It is a significant bridge between research at the university and commercialization of technology by faculty, staff, and students. One of the Research Park\u2019s strengths is that it is a place where the newest startups settling in at EnterpriseWorks feel comfortable rubbing shoulders with established national and international corporations. Educational, training, social, and networking events in the Research Park facilitate a community feel. Partnerships between companies are progressing at a rapid rate.<\/p><p>\u201cThat mixture of Fortune 500 and 100 companies, as well as smaller technology-oriented companies who wanted to become Fortune 500 companies as well as the mixture of new startup companies has been a great plan,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cInterestingly the larger, well-established companies accelerated the speed at which we could bring internships into the park. That really helped get more employment opportunities for students by getting those larger companies in early.\u201d<\/p><p>The Research Park\u2019s public-private partnership with Champaign-based Fox\/Atkins Development has been critical to its success. The University first entered into a partnership with Fox\/Atkins in May 2000 after a competitive bidding process. Fox\/Atkins leases the land from the University, and has built the buildings \u2013 much of it customized \u2013 for the Park\u2019s high-tech tenants.

The\u00a0Research Park\u00a0at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is the most visible result of a significant shift in the history of the University of Illinois: the incorporation of economic development and innovation into its core mission. The Research Park\u2019s beginnings largely mirror the story of the University itself; it has sprouted a vibrant, multidisciplinary community producing highly influential technological advances \u2013 a reflection of the modernization of its land-grant roots in\u00a0agriculture\u00a0and\u00a0engineering\u00a0. \u201cThe mission of the Research Park is much in collaboration with the mission of the University of Illinois,\u201d said Ed McMillan, past chairman of the\u00a0Board of Managers for the Research Park\u00a0and University of Illinois trustee. \u201cIn addition to teaching \u2013 in addition to research and outreach \u2013 it\u2019s also commercialization of technology.\u201d The Research Park was approved by the Board of Trustees in November 1999. The University established a separate University of Illinois Research Park Limited Liability Company in March 2000 for governance of the Research Park. Since the first building opened its doors in January 2001, Research Park\u2019s growth and development have been a boon in multiple ways for the University. Three of its most significant value propositions have been the opportunities afforded for faculty to develop and commercialize new technology in conjunction with their academic work; for established companies to collaborate with University of Illinois faculty and researchers; and for students to experience highly regarded internship opportunities. The Research Park\u2019s thriving innovative community is the result of an intentional transformation in the University of Illinois\u2019 approach to entrepreneurial activity, one that encompasses the entire campus. \u201cIt means many resources are there to support (entrepreneurs), through mentoring and financing and building, as well as promoting that this is a good activity to do,\u201d said\u00a0Laura Appenzeller, Research Park Director. \u201cWe support and encourage entrepreneurship and taking what is being done in a research lab and translating that into a commercializable product.\u201d The State of Illinois provided funding to build\u00a0EnterpriseWorks, the early-stage tech firm business incubator, in 2003, and the first tenants moved in in early 2004. It is a significant bridge between research at the university and commercialization of technology by faculty, staff, and students. One of the Research Park\u2019s strengths is that it is a place where the newest startups settling in at EnterpriseWorks feel comfortable rubbing shoulders with established national and international corporations. Educational, training, social, and networking events in the Research Park facilitate a community feel. Partnerships between companies are progressing at a rapid rate. \u201cThat mixture of Fortune 500 and 100 companies, as well as smaller technology-oriented companies who wanted to become Fortune 500 companies as well as the mixture of new startup companies has been a great plan,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cInterestingly the larger, well-established companies accelerated the speed at which we could bring internships into the park. That really helped get more employment opportunities for students by getting those larger companies in early.\u201d The Research Park\u2019s public-private partnership with Champaign-based Fox\/Atkins Development has been critical to its success. The University first entered into a partnership with Fox\/Atkins in May 2000 after a competitive bidding process. Fox\/Atkins leases the land from the University, and has built the buildings \u2013 much of it customized \u2013 for the Park\u2019s high-tech tenants.
